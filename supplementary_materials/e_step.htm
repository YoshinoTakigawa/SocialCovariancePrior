<h1>
	E-step in Variational Expectation Maximization
</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
E-step in VEM is to determine the variational distribution of hidden random variables \( Z \), or evaluate the corresponding values of variational parameters in \( \theta' \).
</p>

<p>
In our paper, we have stated that the intractability of \( p(Z | R, \theta) \) prevents the probability distribution from being assigned to \( q(Z | \theta') \).
Instead, a common assumption of \( q(Z | \theta') \) is that all the random variables in \( Z \) are independent of each other.
The solution, called <i>mean-field approaximation</i>, can avoid many intractability problems.
The main benefit of mean field is that the joint probability of two dependent random variables can be factorized into two independent probability distributions.
Consequently, it is simpler to analyze the expected value \( \E_{q(Z | \theta')} \left [ \log p(R, Z | \theta) \right ] \).
</p>

<p>
Mean-field assumption brings a practical principle used to analyze the distribution of random variables in \( Z \).
For example, in our model, a latent feature vector \( U_{i} \in Z \) of user \( i \) is derived its posterior distribution using the principle:
\[
	\log q(U_{i} | \theta') = \E_{- q(U_{i} | \theta')} \left [ \log p(R, Z | \theta) \right ] + C
\]
\( C \) is a constant term for \( U_{i} \).
\( - q(U_{i} | \theta') \) means the joint probability distribution of all random variables in \( Z \) except \( U_{i} \) itself.
Here the distribution of \( q(U_{i} | \theta') \) should be known to define what parameters in \( \theta' \) to be analyzed.
Fortunately, using the concept of <i>conjugate priors</i>, we have the same distribution between prior and posterior distributions, and the prior distribution, multivariate normal distribution for \( U_{i} \), is defined in model development.
Thus we can determine \( \theta' = \{ \lambda_{Ui}, \gamma_{Ui} \} \) and evaluate their values.
